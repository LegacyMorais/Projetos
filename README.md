## Projects

### 1. Identification of Rail Faults using AI

Description: I developed and successfully defended my master's thesis "Identification of Rail Faults
using AI". Within the scope of the Ferrovia 4.0 project, and in a laboratory environment at
Digi2Lab, the objective of my work was to develop a functional ML model capable of
accurately predicting the presence of faults on rails. To achieve this objective, several ML
models were developed in an attempt to identify the most efficient approach.
The models developed were Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Boost Machines
and Support Vector Machines. I also used techniques like PCA and Transfer Learning.
Among the libraries used are: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit, NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib.
