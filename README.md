## Projects

### 1. Identification of Rail Faults using AI

Description: I developed and successfully defended my master's thesis "Identification of Rail Faults using AI". Within the scope of the Ferrovia 4.0 project, and in a laboratory environment at Digi2Lab, the objective of my work was to develop a functional ML model capable of accurately predicting the presence of faults on rails. To achieve this objective, several Machine Learning models were developed in an attempt to identify the most efficient approach. The models developed were Neural Networks, Random Forests, Gradient Boost Machines and Support Vector Machines. I also used techniques like PCA and Transfer Learning. Among the libraries used are: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit, NumPy, Pandas and MatPlotLib.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: List of technologies, programming languages, and tools utilized in the project.

### 2. A Comparative Study of IPsec, WireGuard, and OpenVPN: Evaluating End-to-End Encryption and Site-to-Site VPN Solutions

Description: During my time in Torino, in Erasmus, I conducted a project titled "A Comparative Study of IPsec, WireGuard, and OpenVPN: Evaluating End-to-End Encryption and Site-to-Site VPN Solutions". This endeavor involved both theoretical and practical analyses of each VPN solution, encompassing features, protocols, algorithms, and performance metrics. Practical implementation utilized virtual machines, where I meticulously configured the entire network connections from inception.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: Kali Linux, OpenVPN, Wireguard, IPSec, Encryption Algortihms, SSL/TLS, VirtualBox, Bash Scripting

### 3. Bet4Money

Description: As a team of four, we designed and implemented a comprehensive Blackjack application using Java,
delivering a fully functional and engaging gaming experience.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: Java, Eclipse, NetBeans, UI/UX, Scrum

### 4. Robochef

Description: As part of a team of four individuals, we collaborated to create a basic simulated factory comprising six stations, each outfitted with sensors and actuators. These sensors were linked to a database, which in turn interfaced with a C application responsible for overseeing all operations.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: C, UML, SQL, PostgreSQL, RaspberryPI, Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, PlatformIO, Scrum

### 5. LED Matrix

Description: In a group of 2, developed an LED Matrix project. It displayed a futsal match score and game time using an Arduino and a DS3231 RTC for timekeeping and non-volatile memory storage. A user interface with four buttons on a breadboard allows for goal signaling and time control during the game. The application was developed in C.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: Java, Eclipse, NetBeans, UI/UX, Scrum

Link: C, Arduino, Visual Studio Code, PlatformIO, Scrum, Embedded Systems

### 6. sc

Description: Created small-scale projects employing Arduino, the AVR library, and FreeRTOS, focusing on LED control with diverse techniques. Through these projects, I gained proficiency in managing interruptions, timers, preemption, task control, as well as addressing concepts like Race Conditions and Mutual Exclusion.

Technologies / Tools / Methodologies: C, Arduino, FreeRTOS, AVR, Embedded Systems
